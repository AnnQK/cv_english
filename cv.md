#### About me

I love problem solving and seeing results of my work. In September i decided to try something new - programming, and fall in love with this (sometimes it's love-hate relationships).  
I am good at structuring information, planning my tasks and meet deadlines.  
My goal in a short distance is create a training app for me and my friends.  
My long-term goal is became a professional developer.
